Outstanding movie with a haunting performance and best character development ever seen,"Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.

this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen.","every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. grotesque, haunting and cringy. hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. tragic, but with seriously funny moments. emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time. this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development i have ever seen.",every once in a while a movie comes that truly makes an impact joaquins performance and scenography in all its brilliance grotesque haunting and cringy hard to watch at times but so mesmerizing you wont blink an eye watching it tragic but with seriously funny moments emotional rollercoaster  sometimes with multiple emotions poppingup at the same time this is far from a typical actionriddled predictable superhero movie  its a proper psychological thrillerdrama with the single best character development i have ever seen,every once in a while a movie comes that truly makes an impact joaquins performance and scenography in all its brilliance grotesque haunting and cringy hard to watch at times but so mesmerizing you wont blink an eye watching it tragic but with seriously funny moments emotional rollercoaster  sometimes with multiple emotions poppingup at the same time this is far from a typical actionriddled predictable superhero movie  its a proper psychological thrillerdrama with the single best character development i have ever seen,every movie comes truly makes impact joaquins performance scenography brilliance grotesque haunting cringy hard watch times mesmerizing wont blink eye watching tragic seriously funny moments emotional rollercoaster sometimes multiple emotions poppingup time far typical actionriddled predictable superhero movie proper psychological thrillerdrama single best character development ever seen,every movie comes truly makes impact joaquins performance scenography brilliance grotesque hunting cringe hard watch times mesmerizing wont blink eye watching tragic seriously funny moments emotional rollercoaster sometimes multiple emotions popping time far typical actionriddled predictable superhero movie proper psychological thrillerdrama single best character development ever seen,"['every', 'movie', 'comes', 'truly', 'makes', 'impact', 'joaquins', 'performance', 'scenography', 'brilliance', 'grotesque', 'hunting', 'cringe', 'hard', 'watch', 'times', 'mesmerizing', 'wont', 'blink', 'eye', 'watching', 'tragic', 'seriously', 'funny', 'moments', 'emotional', 'rollercoaster', 'sometimes', 'multiple', 'emotions', 'popping', 'time', 'far', 'typical', 'actionriddled', 'predictable', 'superhero', 'movie', 'proper', 'psychological', 'thrillerdrama', 'single', 'best', 'character', 'development', 'ever', 'seen']",everi movi come truli make impact joaquin perform scenographi brillianc grotesqu hunt cring hard watch time mesmer wont blink eye watch tragic serious funni moment emot rollercoast sometim multipl emot pop time far typic actionriddl predict superhero movi proper psycholog thrillerdrama singl best charact develop ever seen,everi movi come truli make impact joaquin perform scenographi brillianc grotesqu hunt cring hard watch time mesmer wont blink eye watch tragic serious funni moment emot rollercoast sometim multipl emot pop time far typic actionriddl predict superhero movi proper psycholog thrillerdrama singl best charact develop ever seen

Perfect in every aspect.,"Truly a masterpiece, The Best Hollywood film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And truly the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife. Remarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting. Some people are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, but it's a necessity and message. It's about society and reflects those underappreciated/unrecognized/bullied people, proving they can do something too. The way it shows class difference, corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and that's what makes it different. It's BELIEVABLE. There could be multiple JOKERs living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people. Consider this a wake up call, a message, but first a film. A PERFECT film.","truly a masterpiece, the best hollywood film of 2019, one of the best films of the decade... and truly the best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real

JUST AMAZING. How does this movie exist.,"Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director","let me start off by saying if joaquin phoneix doesn't get his oscar for this

"A psychological study, rather than a superhero flick","I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.

Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.

It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least. It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.

Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).

I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing.","i have seen joker yesterday at venice an early ill-fated screening. we had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it. joker deserved to be presented at venice film festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are. it focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. and thus, joaquin phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least. it's a take on the joker that differs from ledger's, but i'd say that both are equally as good. the main difference might be that ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while phoenix's is insane to the root. despite being a movie about a superhero villain, joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (i'd exclude the dark knight trilogy only, but joker is easily as good as nolan's movies, or at least very close). it is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive.

Venice 76 review,,,,,,,[],,
I would not call it a masterpiece as some did,,,,,,,[],,
"Finally, a REAL movie","This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of ""bad"" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn't for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.

If you aren't able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn't the best movie for you.","this movie causes the audience to consider

Critics are useless!,"I quit relying on critic reviews years ago... I noticed for this movie that the critics ratings were low but viewer ratings were high. That being said, what is the point of a critic when for this movie, they are oh so wrong. I went and saw this tonite with my mom. I went in skeptical and w some what low expectations. I knew not to expect your typical super hero movie. What we got was a masterpiece. I went in expecting sheer boredom and I was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Each actor took on this character and different levels, different story points and different points in time, so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way!","i quit relying on critic reviews years ago... i noticed for this movie that the critics ratings were low but viewer ratings were high. that

One of the best acting performances I've ever seen,,,,,,,[],,
OK film,"Do not really understand all the tens here. Sure, a good movie, good acting, nice shooting. But the plot is not so intriguing. At times it is really long and somewhat boring. I needed to double-check the genre to see if this is a drama or what. Crime, drama, thriller it said. I would put it maybe 90% in the drama and rest in thriller.

I miss more dialogue, more depth, more substance. The plot is really not more then a somewhat crazy person becoming a bit crazier. Sure there is an undertone in that it is society and the system and the mean character of people that is bringing him down and creating the evil beast which later wants to destroy everything. Absolutely, but I think it is not intriguing story and plot and dialogue enough to give this a ten.

watching yes but not amazing,do not really understand all the tens here sure a good movie good acting nice shooting but the plot is not so intriguing at times it is really long and somewhat boring i

Extremely overrated,"I went into this film expecting an all-time classic based on the reviews I had read & what I ended up watching was just a decent film overall. Phoenix is outstanding...so he definitely did his part. But I feel like if you've seen the trailers you've seen the movie because the best way I can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer. At 2 hours it's a relatively common runtime, but it felt a lot longer...which isn't good. I'd say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie. Kinda just....eh.","i went into this film expecting an all-time classic based on the reviews i had read & what i ended up watching was just a decent film overall. phoenix is outstanding...so he definitely did his part. but i feel like if you've seen the trailers you've seen the movie because the best way i can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer. at 2 hours it's a relatively common runtime, but it felt a lot longer...which isn't good. i'd say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie. kinda just....eh.",i went into this film expecting an alltime classic based on the reviews i had read  what i ended up watching was just a decent film overall phoenix is outstandingso he definitely did his part but i feel like if youve seen the trailers youve seen the movie because the best way i can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer at 2 hours its a relatively common runtime but it felt a lot longerwhich isnt good id say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie kinda justeh,i went into this film expecting an alltime classic based on the reviews i had read  what i ended up watching was just a decent film overall phoenix is outstandingso he definitely did his part but i feel like if youve seen the trailers youve seen the movie because the best way i can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer at 2 hours its a relatively common runtime but it felt a lot longerwhich isnt good id say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie kinda justeh,went film expecting alltime classic based reviews read ended watching decent film overall phoenix outstandingso definitely part feel like youve seen trailers youve seen movie best way describe film feels like 2 hour version trailer 2 hours relatively common runtime felt lot longerwhich isnt good id say much rental theater movie kinda justeh,went film expecting alliee classic based reviews read ended watching decent film overall phoenix outstanding definitely part feel like you seen trailer you seen movie best way describe film feels like 2 hour version trailer 2 hours relatively common auntie felt lot longerwhich isn good id say much rental theater movie kind just,"['went', 'film', 'expecting', 'alliee', 'classic', 'based', 'reviews', 'read', 'ended', 'watching', 'decent', 'film', 'overall', 'phoenix', 'outstanding', 'definitely', 'part', 'feel', 'like', 'you', 'seen', 'trailer', 'you', 'seen', 'movie', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'film', 'feels', 'like', '2', 'hour', 'version', 'trailer', '2', 'hours', 'relatively', 'common', 'auntie', 'felt', 'lot', 'longerwhich', 'isn', 'good', 'id', 'say', 'much', 'rental', 'theater', 'movie', 'kind', 'just']",went film expect allie classic base review read end watch decent film overal phoenix outstand definit part feel like you seen trailer you seen movi best way describ film feel like 2 hour version trailer 2 hour rel common aunti felt lot longerwhich isn good id say much rental theater movi kind just,went film expect allie classic base review read end watch decent film overal phoenix outstand definit part feel like you seen trailer you seen movi best way describ film feel like 2 hour version trailer 2 hour rel common aunti felt lot longerwhich isn good id say much rental theater movi kind just
Is it great? I don't know.,"When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.

Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.

Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.

Film of the year? Nope.","when i heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, i was quite hyped and excited for this movie. when i walked out of the cinema, i felt hollow and empty. before i continue writing, let me say this, this is not the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. the cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. the side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. the plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face. are there no good points though? phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. the cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. it even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty. film of the year? nope.",when i heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10s i was quite hyped and excited for this movie when i walked out of the cinema i felt hollow and empty before i continue writing let me say this this is not the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece the cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible thats just it the sidecharacters are bland and overly dramatic the plot heavily relies on plottwists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on its face are there no good points though phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great the cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all it even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty film of the year nope,when i heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10s i was quite hyped and excited for this movie when i walked out of the cinema i felt hollow and empty before i continue writing let me say this this is not the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece the cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible thats just it the sidecharacters are bland and overly dramatic the plot heavily relies on plottwists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on its face are there no good points though phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great the cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all it even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty film of the year nope,heard everyone saying film year reviews flooding 10s quite hyped excited movie walked cinema felt hollow empty continue writing let say film year real masterpiece cinematography excellent acting incredible thats sidecharacters bland overly dramatic plot heavily relies plottwists film harsh actually falls flat face good points though phoenix phenomenal score great cinematography also incredible plot great even plot holes scenes left empty film year nope,heard everyone saying film year reviews flooding was quite hoped excited movie walked cinema felt hollow empty continue writing let say film year real masterpiece cinematography excellent acting incredible that sidecharacters bland overlay dramatic plot heavily relief plottwists film harsh actually falls flat face good points though phoenix phenomena score great cinematography also incredible plot great even plot holes scenes left empty film year hope,"['heard', 'everyone', 'saying', 'film', 'year', 'reviews', 'flooding', 'was', 'quite', 'hoped', 'excited', 'movie', 'walked', 'cinema', 'felt', 'hollow', 'empty', 'continue', 'writing', 'let', 'say', 'film', 'year', 'real', 'masterpiece', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'acting', 'incredible', 'that', 'sidecharacters', 'bland', 'overlay', 'dramatic', 'plot', 'heavily', 'relief', 'plottwists', 'film', 'harsh', 'actually', 'falls', 'flat', 'face', 'good', 'points', 'though', 'phoenix', 'phenomena', 'score', 'great', 'cinematography', 'also', 'incredible', 'plot', 'great', 'even', 'plot', 'holes', 'scenes', 'left', 'empty', 'film', 'year', 'hope']",heard everyon say film year review flood wa quit hope excit movi walk cinema felt hollow empti continu write let say film year real masterpiec cinematographi excel act incred that sidecharact bland overlay dramat plot heavili relief plottwist film harsh actual fall flat face good point though phoenix phenomena score great cinematographi also incred plot great even plot hole scene left empti film year hope,heard everyon say film year review flood wa quit hope excit movi walk cinema felt hollow empti continu write let say film year real masterpiec cinematographi excel act incred that sidecharact bland overlay dramat plot heavili relief plottwist film harsh actual fall flat face good point though phoenix phenomenon score great cinematographi also incred plot great even plot hole scene left empti film year hope

"Yikes. THIS is people's ""best movie ever""?","The recurring themes of so many of the 10 star reviews here should tell you a lot about this movie and its audience. If you can't get through a movie review without tossing in one or more claims that ""THIS movie is so much better and smarter than YOUR superhero movie"" (or even basing your entire review around this premise), then I hate to break it to you, but kid, you're nowhere near as intelligent and grown up as you think you are. This ""my comic publisher is better than yours"" BS should have been left behind on your grade school playground, it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of this movie, and your opinion of this movie should be considered highly suspect if you're in this group.

I gotta say, if this movie was also your idea of the most perfect film ever made, you really need to get out more. Look, I get it. If you live in a safe little box where all you watch are superhero movies and mainstream blockbusters then I understand how exposure to themes like this for the first time would seem new and exciting to you, and I think we can all agree that this is probably the best DC Comics related movie in the last decade or so (though that's not a high bar to meet) and of course Joaquin Phoenix is a very talented actor, but stop and take a step back and look at this thing.

Joker does indeed present a theme that is of importance to our society, that of the neglect and demonizing of the mentally ill to a degree that sometimes creates monsters which everyone around them should have seen coming a mile away if they hadn't been too busy looking away to avoid feeling uncomfortable. Unfortunately, reminding us all of the fact that this situation still exists is all this movie really has to say. It dances around important subjects like ""HEY KIDS, CLASS INEQUALITY!"", but then never offers any actual insight into them, usually because it's too busy making forced Batman references or dropping cringey little edgy moments like the ""Don't smile"" sign scene which seem to have been designed solely to have something for Hot Topic to print a new t-shirt of. Between that and every single plot twist being telegraphed so very far in advance because a lot of us have seen all these exact same twists so very many times before, I just wasn't impressed.

Perhaps if this had been an actual stand-alone movie of its own instead of being shackled by its completely unnecessary ties to the Batman universe it could have done something more interesting with its themes. Don't get me wrong, I don't have any problem with superhero movies, but it just feels so gratuitous here, as if someone came up with this idea, pitched it to an executive, and was told ""sounds great, but can you make it a Batman movie somehow?"", and I'm sorry, but I'm just not into a movie trying to tell me a half-hearted, yet dead-serious speech about mental illness in modern society while

Extremely overrated,,,,,,,[],,
OMG - Am I getting old or are people getting more stupid,"I was so hyped up to see this movie, loved the trailer, only movie I have wanted to watch in the cinema for a very long time.

I watched it and was bored. the aesthetics were amazing, music was good, story and execution was meh. the performance of the joker was a good performance but people raving about this are driving me mad. either you have not seen many movies or I have seen too many.

this movie was bang average and was actually boring. I was actually thinking about leaving half way through as I was bored out of my mind.

I do not regret watching it but it is being so overhyped that I am so confused right now. I think it had a good premise but could have been so much more, so much more.

Signs of a great movie is the repeat viewing of it or it moving you, joker did not move me whatsoever and I would not watch it again.

I thought maybe people are getting paid to write good review but have actually met people who think it is the best movie ever.... OMGGG

This movie is bang average and way overhyped.

phoenix performance is good but as the story and execution is so bad, I feel he never even touched the higher spectrum of performance he could have with the character.

I have experienced and seen worse in my life, if this made you feel, you are (i hate this word but have to use it) a snowflake. Please get off social media and live life.

Acting Cannot Save Mediocre Script,"They say it's all in the writing. And this is a great example of that. Good acting and production values cannot save a script steeped in tiresome stereotypes and a failure to delve into a character's identity. We meet the Joker when already imbalanced and his so-called descent into madness is really a couple weeks away; far from a descent, it's a stroll. This is not a character study, despite claims to the contrary. It's a showcase of a good actor overly contorting his body and laughing manically as a mistaken expression of madness. Where is the past? Where are the influences? Where are the conflicts? What are the seminal moments that create the spiral? Perhaps if he had really had that relationship, and had it gone sour, it would justify a descent. Instead, it's a fait accompli. This is lazy writing, focused more on fancy long shots of Joaquin Phoenix dancing crazily than producing something of value to the franchise.","they say it's all in the writing. and this is a great

Movie of the Decade,"The pool does not need the money. They need the dignity and respect, coz that is what it takes to be a human.

I made an account just to rate my disappoint for this film.,"I was expecting a masterpiece and oscar worthy film from all the hype. I actually didn't enjoy watching this movie. there was no message, it was slow and the joker turned out just to be the son of a schizophrenic and went crazy over a slight amount of bullying.

I'm just stunned that this has a 9/10 rating right now, how the hell?","i was expecting a masterpiece and oscar worthy film from all the hype. i actually didn't enjoy watching this movie. there was no message, it was slow and the joker turned out just to be the son of a schizophrenic and went crazy over a slight amount of bullying. i don't see how anyone could relate to this character and the laughing is lame acting way overdone. i'm just stunned that this has a 9/10 rating right now, how the hell?",i was expecting a masterpiece and oscar worthy film from all the hype i actually didnt enjoy watching this movie there was no message it was slow and the joker turned out just to be the son of a schizophrenic and went crazy over a slight amount of bullying i dont see how anyone could relate to this character and the laughing is lame acting way overdone im just stunned that this has a 910 rating right now how the hell,i was expecting a masterpiece and oscar worthy film from all the hype i actually didnt enjoy watching this movie there was no message it was slow and the joker turned out just to be the son of a schizophrenic and went crazy over a slight amount of bullying i dont see how anyone could relate to this character and the laughing is lame acting way overdone im just stunned that this has a 910 rating right now how the hell,expecting masterpiece oscar worthy film hype actually didnt enjoy watching movie message slow joker turned son schizophrenic went crazy slight amount bullying dont see anyone could relate character laughing lame acting way overdone im stunned 910 rating right hell,expecting masterpiece oscar worthy film hope actually didn enjoy watching movie message slow joke turned son schizophrenic went crazy slight amount building dont see anyone could relate character laughing lame acting way everyone in stunned 910 rating right hell,"['expecting', 'masterpiece', 'oscar', 'worthy', 'film', 'hope', 'actually', 'didn', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'movie', 'message', 'slow', 'joke', 'turned', 'son', 'schizophrenic', 'went', 'crazy', 'slight', 'amount', 'building', 'dont', 'see', 'anyone', 'could', 'relate', 'character', 'laughing', 'lame', 'acting', 'way', 'everyone', 'in', 'stunned', '910', 'rating', 'right', 'hell']",expect masterpiec oscar worthi film hope actual didn enjoy watch movi messag slow joke turn son schizophren went crazi slight amount build dont see anyon could relat charact laugh lame act way everyon in stun 910 rate right hell,expect masterpiec oscar worthi film hope actual didn enjoy watch movi messag slow joke turn son schizophren went crazi slight amount build dont see anyon could relat charact laugh lame act way everyon in stun 910 rate right hell

CLOWN PRINCE OF CRIME has arrived,"10/10 Amazing story, Brilliant taking, magnificent cinematography. Someone had to step out of the safe game played by Superhero movies and Joker movie does just that (also The Boys). Movie is gritty, real, insanely dark and sometime quite disturbing to people who don't want accept what's shown in the movie is a terrible reality we face everyday if refused a proper care. Normally people start to compare the movie with one of the greatest like The Dark Knight and in acting wise to that of Heath ledger's Potrayal of joker. I wouldn't say this movie is better that that or otherwise , but it will stand tall amongst the greatest like The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Citizen Kane, The Dark Knight. Coming to the inevitable comparison of who's the better Joker? Heath or Joaquin. The answer is Both did a phenomenal job and the Joker character itself is fortunate to have being played by two greatest actors. Definitely a top contender for Oscars. I personally think it would take away 1.Best Actor 2.Cinematography 3.Original score and if Once Upon a time in Hollywood loses in Make-up and hairstyling category it would definitely be to The Joker.","10/10 amazing story, brilliant taking, magnificent cinematography. someone had to step out of the safe game played by superhero movies and joker movie does just that (also the boys). movie is

The Rise of the Joker!,"Joaquin' portrayal of a sociopathic, mentally unstable man's transformation to the iconic Joker was non other than a grippingly accurate, realistic and touching rendition. A dark and disturbing character piece led by an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we've never seen him like this. We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we're almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he's the joker, we wish we could've helped him. There's a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece. That can only be the mark of a great movie. All the acting is great, the plot (while similar to Taxi Driver) is brilliant and the quality of the movie shows you don't need CGI super powers to be a great villain in a Superhero movie.

Horrible job of portraying the character,"If it wasn't for the title and make-up, you wouldn't know it was based on the comic-book character. First of all, the real Joker is not a weak and unconfident pushover. Not even in his genesis stage. The real Joker had a high tolerance for pain, could fight and was intelligent. Which made him dangerous due to his insanity. When Joaquin shoots the guy on the subway, he does it out of cowardice. They try to make up for it with the Murray shooting scene. There is no way that Joaquin's Joker will ever fill the shoes of the badass Joker in the comics, not even the different incarnations by different comic authors....and just forget about even coming close to Heath Ledger's portrayal.

Joke's on You,"This film is about mental illness. Specifically, a mental illness called creative diarrhoea.

Seriously though, there is sooo much wrong with this movie. I won't even start with how I knew that a Joker sob story had no hope of (artistic) success, nor with why I went I went to see it anyway. I'll start by pointing out other reviewers' observation that this is not even the Joker. He's not suave, he's not witty, there are no lethal gimmicks, no morbid jokes, no anarchism, and he isn't a criminal mastermind. He's just a loser that goes off on a school shooter streak.

Secondly, this is not, as I said earlier, a film about mental illness. It is a mockery of it, cashing in on the increasing awareness about mental health. There is not one concept about psychosis or other mental health problems judiciously explored in the movie (an illness which causes the sufferer to laugh in inappropriate situations? Seriously?!). All you're getting here is a downtrodden loner being subjected to beatings and injustices designed to spark indignation in the viewer, then going off on a murder spree.

With regards to the much-praised acting, it's a mystery to me how anyone could have come to a judgement of Phoenix's theatrical achievement based off such an asinine script, because I can't. Not that you should devote an iota of attention to any of these positive reviews, because I'm fairly confident that there is some large-scale review rigging going on.

The plot is one dimensional and juvenile, the dialogue as engaging as a monotone nursery rhyme and the character development shallow. There were goofs left right and centre, like revolvers with zero recoil and 8 bullets. Why did Arthur keep dancing? Why did we need to see Arthur fondling himself? Why is he so emaciated? Why so much smoking? I watched so many close-ups of cigarettes burn out it makes me wonder if the film was sponsored by the tobacco industry.

The two positives in the movie for me were firstly, the final talk show scene, littered though it was with imperfections like the rest of the movie, which did have me sitting a little less slouched in my seat. Also, there were some interesting theories presented tying the Joker with the Batman.

With the bar set so high by The Dark Knight, no director seeking artistic acclaim will go near the Joker for many years to come, maybe ever, but on the other hand, the Joker character has been rendered a boon for Hollywood opportunists, and this is the second time we've seen the character butchered in a low effort high budget money maker. This one will be forgotten quick, but I don't know how long it will be before the Joker himself recovers.","this film is about mental illness. specifically, a mental illness called creative diarrhoea.

Don't be SHEEP,,,,,,,[],,
Anyone who rates this movie poorly clearly doesn't appreciate cinema,"While the trailers for this movie have may seemed like there was potential for an action packed movie, this movie, clearly before it came to theaters was intended to be a progressive character study. You shouldn't go into this movie expecting intense action or the joker we know of the past. This is a movie about how Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker.

I have seen so many bad reviews about how boring or slow the movie is, but I believe it was utter perfection. The first part of the movie we begin to understand Arthur as a person. All of his interactions with everyone in his life, be it good or bad. The whole point of a character study is evolution. And this is far and away one of the greatest evolutions of a character I have ever seen in a movie.

Joaquin Phoenix's performance is by far the best acting I have seen in a movie possibly in the last few decades. We see a challenged person be challenged by society and it completely breaks him down over time. And Joaquin isn't acting, he is evolving all throughout the movie. If anyone thinks he doesn't put on an Oscar winning performance, they're out of their effing mind. Yes, the movie is slow to start, but it has to be. We couldn't just jump into the joker and all the chaos. We need to know where it came from to begin with.

The whole compilation of the movie is amazing. The complete Oscar deserving performance of Joaquin, the choreography, the cinematography, the score. Everything is in perfect harmony. While there may have been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie, the team put together a perfect movie and I pity those who can't appreciate the tears and sweat and emotion that went into making this movie.

I have always been so one sided in my movie preferences between Marvel and DC. I feel like Marvel is sooo much better overall and most movies DC puts out are trash. But Joker is far and away my favorite comic movie. Even though it takes a completely different spin on comic movies. You have to appreciate the evolution to appreciate this movie. It's not an action movie, but it's really rips and tears at all the emotions in one movie while adding a wild suspenseful kick. No other comic book movie has done that before.","while the trailers for this movie have may seemed like there was potential for an action packed movie, this movie, clearly before it came to theaters

a person all of his interactions with everyone in his life be it good or bad the whole point of a character study is evolution and this is far and away one of the greatest evolutions of a character i have ever seen in a movie joaquin phoenixs performance is by far the best acting i have seen in a movie possibly in the last few decades we see a challenged person be challenged by society and it completely breaks him down over time and joaquin isnt acting he is evolving all throughout the movie if anyone thinks he doesnt put on an oscar winning performance theyre out of their effing mind yes the movie is slow to start but it has to be we couldnt just jump into the joker and all the chaos we need to know where it came from to begin with the whole compilation of the movie is amazing the

team put together a perfect movie and i pity those who cant appreciate the tears and sweat and emotion that went into making this movie i have always been so one sided in my movie preferences between marvel and dc i feel like marvel is sooo much better overall and most movies dc puts out are trash but joker is far and away my favorite comic movie even though it takes a completely different spin on

A Represintation of a Real Life Joker.,"This movie answers this question...what will the Joker be if he was a real life character ? A great deep and moving story, a life journey of a man who's suffering from some psychological issues and how neglect, bullying and rudeness by other human being can push a man to complete madness.

Although it's not accurate to any comic book adaptation or any TV series or movie before it, yet it's a fresh and unique take on the character of the clown prince of crime from a realistic approach and I believe with Joaquin Phoenix amazing performance as the Joker in which he managed to bring a real life look-alike early version of the Joker which although is not comic book accurate but I feel it's a very decent foundation for Joker 2 which should be more true to heart of the original version of our lovable villain.

The movie is over all a great piece of filmmaking in all of its aspects. From the plot which was very interesting, believable and many can relate to it, through the acting which was impressively splendid to the directing which was outstanding. My main take on the movie is the lack of any positive lead character, I know we live in a tough world which full of negativity but there are some positive examples here and there and to shed some light on one or two characters in this movie would've been a nice positive thought.

The Joker movie can be misunderstood by many thinking it'll inspire crime and violence but I believe on the contrary that many who go through hard life will feel sympathy for the Joker character, others will even relate to his misery and may justify his actions. I believe the movie is meant to be a wake up call for many! A lot of people daily suffer from bullying, racism, hate crimes or neglect and sometimes they go through worse, we should take a deeper look at our actions and know that - aside from money and authority - we are all equally humans, we should treat one another the same way we expect to be treated.","this movie answers this question...what will the joker be if he was a real life character ? a

"Disturbing, Riveting, Off-The-Chart Performance by Pheonix","Joaquin Phoenix produces one of the most memorable performances ever captured in a feature film, earning the hardware and accolades he received for his stunning and disturbing portayal of Joker.

Joaquin puts on a virtuoso spotlight performance, and elevates the movie to legendary status. Credit director Todd Philips for building tension throughout the film, capturing the nuances of Joker's tortured dark-side slide into deranged, violent insanity, keeping the film's pace and flow on-track without unnecessary fill, utilizing and applying various camera lenses, shot angles, lighting, colors/hues, aperture settings (e.g. bokeh), and scene framing, and allowing Joaquin to tap into his own dark corners and utilize his unique acting instincts in developing his character.

Phoenix's acting performance leaves nothing on the table - if keeping score, Phoenix tallies a perfect 10 producing a truly legendary performance, transforming the film from God knows what it would have been with another actor to a 9/10.

A performance and film that one will not easily forget.","joaquin phoenix produces one of the most memorable performances ever captured in a feature film, earning the hardware and accolades he

"just a joke,the movie.","I'm keeping it short, the movie sucks.

Stop comparing it with Endgame,"Joker is literally an achievement in cinematic history there's no doubt in that ! But why people comparing it with Endgame ?

In your face call for justice that upsets the corrupt elite,"There is a reason why this masterpiece is being panned by the crony capitalist critics. It challenges their all too comfortable fake construction of reality and it does so in such an effective way, that it almost automatically elicits a dishonest, knee-jerk defensive reaction from them, frightened to the bone that their gaslighting charade might get uncovered. It is not Joker that is delusional, it is they that sell delusions in order to maintain the status quo.

But, eventually, and they know it, you get what you deserve. That sentence and that sentiment is what so scares them, because this movie cuts too close to the bone, and like all great, game-changing art, it is just a bit too true.

When Joker, who is a true hero here, helps a character, equally mistreated by the powers that be, go free, he points that he was the only one that treated him well. This is a call for kindness that is essence of the movie, but it is barely noticed by those who, like the villain of the movie, Thomas Wayne, think we are all despicable clowns. So they lie and pool wool over our eyes, as they only can, misconstrue and make false scares, so that the point of the movie that is most damaging for them would not get across.

All these are marks of a great movie. In Europe, it was instantly recognized - and rewarded, for the subversive potential it has. In North America, it scared the hell out of conformists, and the reaction was, for many, an almost reflexive rejection. Which means it hit, it hit hard, quite uncomfortably so. And if anything the hypo crites hate so much, it is the movie that exposes them, and, even more so, exposes the paper tiger of the blood sucking system they depend on for what it is.","there is a

Joker's laughter is no joking matter,"Writer-director Todd Phillips's new movie ""Joker"" appeals to me on multiple levels, primarily by offering an engaging story, strongly rooted in believable reality, related to audiences mainly by opposing protagonist's prevalent dark depressive moods while using often optimistic soundtrack and sound editing, shallow nonetheless rich visuals, angles and framing, theatricality augmented through expressive costumes, props and sets, but most impressively via great principal performances and acting choices made by Joaquin Phoenix in the lead as a title character (under proper fictional name Arthur Fleck), whose sudden uncontrollable and seemingly inappropriate laughter (justified as a medical condition) easily counterpoints the (painful need for) outcry from Gotham (read: any) City masses, hurt and deprived by injustices of their quotidian existence, as well as by Robert De Niro in a quintessential supporting role of a TV-comedy show host Murray Franklin (both worthy of the end-of-the-year acting award considerations), and by setting believable pre-course for the future adventures of the most realistic DC Comics character, the Batman (not a superhero at all, with his extraordinary capabilities rather resulting from his physical fitness and skills combined with high technology employed), who appears here only as a young boy, and whose later adult activities could be understood as largely driven by what has happened to his parents in the final scene of this movie, an event directly inspired by actions of Joker, henceforth his

No.. Just... no.,"I'm making sure to give this movie 1 star because it's definitely not a 8.9 - that's a lie.

Joker is not an amazing movie. It's far from great. More to the boring side.

It lacks plot twist and focus too much on character development. How many times someone needs to get punched in the face before they go crazy?

He suffers, gets fired, has a mental illness, nobody loves him, he's sad and he cries and he laughs and he laughs again. And he kills some people, and that's it, that's the movie.","i'm making sure to give this movie 1 star because it's definitely not a 8.9 - that's a lie. joker is not an amazing movie. it's far from great. more to the boring side. it lacks plot twist and focus too much on character development. how many times someone needs to get punched in the face before they go crazy? he suffers, gets fired, has a mental illness, nobody loves him, he's sad and he cries and he laughs and he laughs again. and he kills some people, and that's it, that's the movie.",im making sure to give this movie 1 star because its definitely not a 89  thats a lie joker is not an amazing movie its far from great more to the boring side it lacks plot twist and focus too much on character development how many times someone needs to get punched in the face before they go crazy he suffers gets fired has a mental illness nobody loves him hes sad and he cries and he laughs and he laughs again and he kills some people and thats it thats the movie,im making sure to give this movie 1 star because its definitely not a 89  thats a lie joker is not an amazing movie its far from great more to the boring side it lacks plot twist and focus too much on character development how many times someone needs to get punched in the face before they go crazy he suffers gets fired has a mental illness nobody loves him hes sad and he cries and he laughs and he laughs again and he kills some people and thats it thats the movie,im making sure give movie 1 star definitely 89 thats lie joker amazing movie far great boring side lacks plot twist focus much character development many times someone needs get punched face go crazy suffers gets fired mental illness nobody loves hes sad cries laughs laughs kills people thats thats movie,in making sure give movie 1 star definitely 89 that lie joke amazing movie far great boring side lacks plot twist focus much character development many times someone needs get punched face go crazy suffers gets fired mental illness nobody loves he sad cries laughs laughs kills people that that movie,"['in', 'making', 'sure', 'give', 'movie', '1', 'star', 'definitely', '89', 'that', 'lie', 'joke', 'amazing', 'movie', 'far', 'great', 'boring', 'side', 'lacks', 'plot', 'twist', 'focus', 'much', 'character', 'development', 'many', 'times', 'someone', 'needs', 'get', 'punched', 'face', 'go', 'crazy', 'suffers', 'gets', 'fired', 'mental', 'illness', 'nobody', 'loves', 'he', 'sad', 'cries', 'laughs', 'laughs', 'kills', 'people', 'that', 'that', 'movie']",in make sure give movi 1 star definit 89 that lie joke amaz movi far great bore side lack plot twist focu much charact develop mani time someon need get punch face go crazi suffer get fire mental ill nobodi love he sad cri laugh laugh kill peopl that that movi,in make sure give movi 1 star definit 89 that lie joke amaz movi far great bore side lack plot twist focu much charact develop mani time someon need get punch face go crazi suffer get fire mental ill nobodi love he sad cri laugh laugh kill peopl that that movi
Best DC movie since The Dark Knight Rises,"DC can STILL give us a compelling movie. Wasn't quite hyped about it, I mean, an origin story of a villain made by the director of Hangover movies; what could I even expect? Then, the reviews started to drop. Still wasn't sure if I would like it. And after I saw it, it was way better than I thought it would be. I won't call it a masterpiece, but it definitely is on my top 3 DC films of all times!

Good : There's hardly anything bad about Joker. Joaquin Phoenix does a great job of bringing the character into life. Rather than a typical superhero/supervillain origin story, we get to see a psychological drama + horror, and thank God, we got that. I love the genre, I love films like Infinity War, Days of Future Past, Endgame and Raimi's Spider-Man. But occasionally, it's really good to take a break from such films. It's, kind of, in the category of films like Unbreakable. Basically, the movie is (no spoilers ahead) Arthur, being tormented by the society and being a mentally unstable loner, loses his mind after the constant torment and after that, all hell breaks loose. That's all the movie shows. It would be quite difficult to give a really good story for a plot like this, since there are many movies with this kind of plot (awfully crappy ones included). I completely liked this movie, means the screenplay and direction worked for me. You can feel for Arthur, whenever the movie asks you to. You want to root for Arthur, but you know that it will mean some incredibly terrible things will happen. We see him slowly transition into Joker, and when he completely turns into the Joker it is worth a round of applause. We feel good as well as terrified with the actions of the Joker whenever he snaps and crazy stuff happens. Without getting into spoilers, I would say - in short - that it has many quotable lines and each of them make sense. Whatever Joker (a psychopath) says is more realistic than what a sane person says. And obviously has some sick, terrifying and gruesome Joker moments that a proper Joker movie should have. If it's not clear by the trailers, there's no Batman here. But (again, no spoilers) it does have some Batman references to support the movie. It could've created a mess and might have felt like a shoehorned plotline, but it plays out as a proper support for the main story and the transition of Arthur into Joker.

Mixed : It is a good thing that the movie has a 70s psycho horror vibe to it. But, it could've been more original. Like many others have pointed out, it's similar to Taxi Driver by Scorsese. While it wasn't a copy and paste of Taxi Driver, but some parts make it obvious that the movie was inspired by Taxi Driver. Not necessarily a bad thing, the movie has the elements as a homage-ish way, but looking at how well made it was, it could've been slightly more original. And, it may feel a bit slow for some people, though it's worth your time.

My take on the controversy : It can happen that some morons might watch this film and cause violence. It can happen with any violent movie. But, even though it justified the Joker's actions, it doesn't show them to be right. Speaking of violence, it's just psychologically compelling horror. It's less violent than Deadpool, but feels more violent as it's a serious movie. So, glorification and siding with a psychopath is a complete and total nonsense.

Conclusion : It's a must watch. You don't need to follow any of the DC movies to understand it. But do not expect it to be a typical superhero action film with CGI battles and a spectacle. Wrong expectations might ruin the experience. Else, I found it to be better than The Dark Knight Rises. And TDKR is one of my favorites in the genre. If a Nolan movie is replaced by another movie in my list, you may consider it to be great. One last thing, people causing violence because of Joker would be equivalent to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly inspiring three people to have a gun duel for some gold.

Rating:

Score : 10/10

"Over-hyped, overacted with no proper entertainment - The Millennial Joker","Absolute disappointment. I believed the hype like a fool. No person that actually saw it told me it was a good movie, just the stupid reviews. It's so cringe, with nothing actually happening except Phoenix smoking and dancing around. There is no action, no substance, no humor. Everything is so cringe and overacted. I suppose if you like those independent movies at TIFF or Cannes this is something for you. If you actually wanna be entertained and see The Joker from the DC, this is not it. Best description is millennial joker. Society is mean to him, nobody gives him anything so he cries and complains about it to get attention. When none is given, he starts killing.","absolute disappointment. i believed the hype like a fool. no person that actually saw it told me it was a good movie, just the stupid reviews. it's so cringe, with nothing actually happening except phoenix smoking and dancing around. there is no action, no substance, no humor. everything is so cringe and overacted. i suppose if you like those independent movies at tiff or cannes this is something for you. if you actually wanna be entertained and see the joker from the dc, this is not it. best description is millennial joker. society is mean to him, nobody gives him anything so he cries and complains about it to get attention. when none is given, he starts killing.",absolute disappointment i believed the hype like a fool no person that actually saw it told me it was a good movie just the stupid reviews its so cringe with nothing actually happening except phoenix smoking and dancing around there is no action no substance no humor everything is so cringe and overacted i suppose if you like those independent movies at tiff or cannes this is something for you if you actually wanna be entertained and see the joker from the dc this is not it best description is millennial joker society is mean to him nobody gives him anything so he cries and complains about it to get attention when none is given he starts killing,absolute disappointment i believed the hype like a fool no person that actually saw it told me it was a good movie just the stupid reviews its so cringe with nothing actually happening except phoenix smoking and dancing around there is no action no substance no humor everything is so cringe and overacted i suppose if you like those independent movies at tiff or cannes this is something for you if you actually wanna be entertained and see the joker from the dc this is not it best description is millennial joker society is mean to him nobody gives him anything so he cries and complains about it to get attention when none is given he starts killing,absolute disappointment believed hype like fool person actually saw told good movie stupid reviews cringe nothing actually happening except phoenix smoking dancing around action substance humor everything cringe overacted suppose like independent movies tiff cannes something actually wanna entertained see joker dc best description millennial joker society mean nobody gives anything cries complains get attention none given starts killing,absolute disappointment believed hope like fool person actually saw told good movie stupid reviews cringe nothing actually happening except phoenix smoking dancing around action substance humor everything cringe operated suppose like independent moves stiff lannes something actually anna entertained see joke do best description millennium joke society mean nobody gives anything cries complains get attention none given starts killing,"['absolute', 'disappointment', 'believed', 'hope', 'like', 'fool', 'person', 'actually', 'saw', 'told', 'good', 'movie', 'stupid', 'reviews', 'cringe', 'nothing', 'actually', 'happening', 'except', 'phoenix', 'smoking', 'dancing', 'around', 'action', 'substance', 'humor', 'everything', 'cringe', 'operated', 'suppose', 'like', 'independent', 'moves', 'stiff', 'lannes', 'something', 'actually', 'anna', 'entertained', 'see', 'joke', 'do', 'best', 'description', 'millennium', 'joke', 'society', 'mean', 'nobody', 'gives', 'anything', 'cries', 'complains', 'get', 'attention', 'none', 'given', 'starts', 'killing']",absolut disappoint believ hope like fool person actual saw told good movi stupid review cring noth actual happen except phoenix smoke danc around action substanc humor everyth cring oper suppos like independ move stiff lann someth actual anna entertain see joke do best descript millennium joke societi mean nobodi give anyth cri complain get attent none given start kill,absolut disappoint believ hope like fool person actual saw told good movi stupid review cring noth actual happen except phoenix smoke danc around action substanc humor everyth cring oper suppos like independ move stiff lann someth actual anna entertain see joke do best descript millennium joke societi mean nobodi give anyth cri complain get attent none given start kill
Insult to the best comic book villain of all time,,,,,,,[],,
I don't get what everyone else seems to be seeing.,"I do agree that Joaquin's performance was great, very well done and not an easy part to pull off. That however, was the only good part of the film. Movie was dark as I expected, but so much SLOW dialog it was putting me to sleep. Parts of the movie were VERY predictable, though a couple (literally two) of surprises that were good but didn't out weigh a very slow moving poorly laid out story. I say skip this one and wait for it to hit the other subscription services, I'd ask for my money back but I did stay till the end.","i do agree that joaquin's performance was great, very well done and not an easy part to pull off. that however, was the only good part of the film. movie was dark as i expected, but so much slow dialog it was putting me to sleep. parts of the movie were very predictable, though a couple (literally two) of surprises that were good but didn't out weigh a very slow moving poorly laid out story. i say skip this one and wait for it to hit the other subscription services, i'd ask for my money back but i did stay till the end.",i do agree that joaquins performance was great very well done and not an easy part to pull off that however was the only good part of the film movie was dark as i expected but so much slow dialog it was putting me to sleep parts of the movie were very predictable though a couple literally two of surprises that were good but didnt out weigh a very slow moving poorly laid out story i say skip this one and wait for it to hit the other subscription services id ask for my money back but i did stay till the end,i do agree that joaquins performance was great very well done and not an easy part to pull off that however was the only good part of the film movie was dark as i expected but so much slow dialog it was putting me to sleep parts of the movie were very predictable though a couple literally two of surprises that were good but didnt out weigh a very slow moving poorly laid out story i say skip this one and wait for it to hit the other subscription services id ask for my money back but i did stay till the end,agree joaquins performance great well done easy part pull however good part film movie dark expected much slow dialog putting sleep parts movie predictable though couple literally two surprises good didnt weigh slow moving poorly laid story say skip one wait hit subscription services id ask money back stay till end,agree joaquins performance great well done easy part pull however good part film movie dark expected much slow diploe putting sleep parts movie predictable though couple literally two surprise good didn weigh slow moving poorly laid story say skin one wait hit subscription services id ask money back stay till end,"['agree', 'joaquins', 'performance', 'great', 'well', 'done', 'easy', 'part', 'pull', 'however', 'good', 'part', 'film', 'movie', 'dark', 'expected', 'much', 'slow', 'diploe', 'putting', 'sleep', 'parts', 'movie', 'predictable', 'though', 'couple', 'literally', 'two', 'surprise', 'good', 'didn', 'weigh', 'slow', 'moving', 'poorly', 'laid', 'story', 'say', 'skin', 'one', 'wait', 'hit', 'subscription', 'services', 'id', 'ask', 'money', 'back', 'stay', 'till', 'end']",agre joaquin perform great well done easi part pull howev good part film movi dark expect much slow diplo put sleep part movi predict though coupl liter two surpris good didn weigh slow move poorli laid stori say skin one wait hit subscript servic id ask money back stay till end,agre joaquin perform great well done easi part pull howev good part film movi dark expect much slow diplo put sleep part movi predict though coupl liter two surpris good didn weigh slow move poorli laid stori say skin one wait hit subscript servic id ask money back stay till end
Overrated and badly directed film with a misleading title,"Joker is basically the lite edition or postmodern version of Fight Club or the Scorsese films it lifts from. It's interesting to see how easily words like masterpiece and groundbreaking are being used for this, and that is the one joke that this movie successfully pulls off. It's just a whole lot of self-seriousness and posturing and is essentially hollow. It pretends to say a lot but ends up saying very little or nothing at all, not about the character nor about the society he's part of.

It is also 'Joker' only in name and has very little to do with the super-villain. I'm all for a different interpretation and even an origin story for the joker but this movie fails to recognise or capture his spirit. Even 'Proto-Joker' doesn't quite do it justice, and I can think of a dozen more suitable titles e.g. Arthur, The Untalented Mr. Fleck, Smoker, Poser etc. Infact he's more akin to a less dangerous but also mentally unstable villain like Ratcatcher or Calendar Man though just with a clown theme, and is not even close to embodying the joker's extreme form of nihilism. It's not that it has to be a comic-book accurate portrayal, that would be irrelevant if it was genuinely a good movie. But far from being a masterpiece , it doesn't quite manage even that. It fails not just as an inaccurate portrayal of the Joker's spirit or essence, but also as a film about a person going over the edge.

The weakest aspect of the movie for me is the poor to average direction. The movie lacks any of the subtlety and nuance that I was hoping for and what unfolds is not as much character development as it is things happening to Arthur. A good example of the poor writing and direction is the very Trump-like and one-dimensional Thomas Wayne character. This first became obvious during a scene in which some people happened to know the entire lyrics to a clown song. In a movie that otherwise tries very hard to be realistic that felt very unnecessary and took me out of the experience and it felt very contrived and predictable after that. It takes too many obvious liberties and plot conveniences to move the story forward in an unnatural and unrefined way, and ultimately felt like they tried to disguise the poor writing and direction with a dark and gritty atmosphere instead of those elements complementing each other.

The only reason to watch this movie is Phoenix's performance, which while not groundbreaking is good enough to earn an awards nomination or two. I wouldn't put it in the same league as Heath Ledger's portrayal but they were two very different roles and characters. Ledger made his joker seem effortless while one can really see the strain and work Phoenix puts in. To put it simply, Ledger made it seem natural and didn't look like he was acting while with Phoenix you really know that he is, even to the extent that it may seem like overacting at times. Perhaps owing to the more physical nature of this version of whoever this character is supposed to be, that's not necessarily a criticism.

Overall an average film at best that pretends to be a lot more. I don't see this one ageing well or being remembered decades later the way Fight Club or the Scorsese movies it's ""inspired"" by, or CBM's like Dark Knight or Logan or even Tim Burton's Batman, are remembered today.","joker is basically the lite edition or postmodern version of fight club or the scorsese films it lifts from. it's interesting to see how easily words like masterpiece and

I really don't understand.,"Joaquin Phoenix is good. The directing is pretty good. The writing is absolutely awful. This movie is trying so hard to be relevant and to have a 'message' that it just throws a jumbled mess of quasi-commentary at you hoping something will stick. It is completely unclear what exactly writer/director Todd Phillips is actually trying to say, if anything. Is Joker a hero of the resistance or is he an incel? Does he go crazy because he's mentally ill or because people are mean to him? Both rich people and poor people are horrible to Joker so what exactly is the class commentary? It's also confusing how Robert De Niro when this movie is clearly ripping off Taxi Driver in many ways, also with a little Mr. Robot thrown in. There's also a subplot with a neighbor that is so incredibly stupid and pointless, which actually has no bearing on the story whatsoever. The movie is also just listless and boring throughout much of it. A movie can be slow-paced without it being boring if interesting things are happening that are driving the plot towards it's conclusion. The only thing driving the story in this movie is knowing that he's going to become joker at some points, not anything that actually happens in the movie. The movie also spends like 5 minutes making fun of a little person for no clear reason. Also for people saying that this movie does a good job saying why you should be nicer to people especially if they're lonely or have mental health issues: firstly you shouldn't need a movie like this to be nice to people, secondly you can make a movie like that where the lonely/mentally ill person doesn't become a murderer since mentally ill people are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crime, and thirdly if you want a movie showing why you need to empathize with criminals why not movies about all the people of color who have been victims of mass incarceration and were locked up on nonviolent charges instead of a movie about a white male becoming a mass murderer. This movie is terrible.","joaquin phoenix is good. the directing is pretty good. the writing is absolutely awful. this movie is trying so hard to be relevant and to have a 'message' that it just

"Dark, serious, tense... and bad!","Somehow the darkest and most serious movies get the highest ratings. People say that this movie is so thrilling and that Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar but at the end of the day, it wasn't entertainment. There were so many evil moments and dark scenes but what's so good about that?

This movie was almost like instructions on how to be a psycho. They flipped the usual idea and boundaries of good and evil for the audience to feel sorry for the bad guy. People seem to think this is a good thing. It's bad!

The point of a movie is to entertain audiences and this movie just made me feel depressed and miserable. I'll have to watch a movie where the hero is clear and the villain is clear so I can actually be entertained.

Murdering the Joker,"This film tries desperately to devillify the most stylish and charismatic villain in the DC universe and excruciatingly transform him into a poster child for mental illness in the most tedious manner possible.. This version of the Joker lacks any semblance of style, luster, flair, or charisma, leaving me to wonder why anyone would bother investing the time and money required to create this turkey, much less watch it.

They've murdered the Joker for the sake of some social commentary and PC promotion. I don't deny that mental illness is a real issue or that attention should be brought to it, but folks watch movies about supervillians to see super-villainy, not a 2 hour public service announcement. I hung in there as long as I could hoping for this movie to redeem itself, but about 3 quarters of the way through I could take no more of watching it spin it's wheels.

If you are a fan of the Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger versions of the Joker then you will likely find this film as painful to watch as I did.","this film tries desperately to devillify the most

Uncomfortably Satisfying,"To say it was satisfying would be somewhat misleading. Joaquin Phoenix makes you feel uncomfortable almost the entire time. I couldn't help thinking about Christian Bale in The Machinist and Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver. With those comparisons, clearly I have some high praise on the acting.

The film itself slowly builds momentum, but when it builds...it's really builds. Those looking for traditional comic book action may feel it moves a bit slow, but it's pace allows for the transformation to not feel superficial. When you walk out of the theater you won't know exactly how to feel, but you'll surely want to know how everyone else feels about it.","to say it was satisfying would be somewhat misleading. joaquin phoenix makes you feel uncomfortable almost the entire time. i couldn't help thinking about christian bale in the machinist and robert de niro in taxi driver. with those comparisons, clearly i have some high praise on the acting. the film itself slowly builds momentum, but when it builds...it's really builds. those looking for traditional comic book action may feel it moves a bit slow, but it's pace allows for the transformation to not feel superficial. when you walk out of the theater you won't know exactly how to feel, but you'll surely want to know how everyone else feels about it.",to say it was satisfying would be somewhat misleading joaquin phoenix makes you feel uncomfortable almost the entire time i couldnt help thinking about christian bale in the machinist and robert de niro in taxi driver with those comparisons clearly i have some high praise on the acting the film itself slowly builds momentum but when it buildsits really builds those looking for traditional comic book action may feel it moves a bit slow but its pace allows for the transformation to not feel superficial when you walk out of the theater you wont know exactly how to feel but youll surely want to know how everyone else feels about it,to say it was satisfying would be somewhat misleading joaquin phoenix makes you feel uncomfortable almost the entire time i couldnt help thinking about christian bale in the machinist and robert de niro in taxi driver with those comparisons clearly i have some high praise on the acting the film itself slowly builds momentum but when it buildsits really builds those looking for traditional comic book action may feel it moves a bit slow but its pace allows for the transformation to not feel superficial when you walk out of the theater you wont know exactly how to feel but youll surely want to know how everyone else feels about it,say satisfying would somewhat misleading joaquin phoenix makes feel uncomfortable almost entire time couldnt help thinking christian bale machinist robert de niro taxi driver comparisons clearly high praise acting film slowly builds momentum buildsits really builds looking traditional comic book action may feel moves bit slow pace allows transformation feel superficial walk theater wont know exactly feel youll surely want know everyone else feels,say satisfying would somewhat misleading joaquin phoenix makes feel uncomfortable almost entire time couldn help thinking christian able machines robert de no taxi driver comparisons clearly high praise acting film slowly build momentum buildsits really build looking traditional comic book action may feel moves bit slow pace allows transformation feel superficial walk theater wont know exactly feel you surely want know everyone else feels,"['say', 'satisfying', 'would', 'somewhat', 'misleading', 'joaquin', 'phoenix', 'makes', 'feel', 'uncomfortable', 'almost', 'entire', 'time', 'couldn', 'help', 'thinking', 'christian', 'able', 'machines', 'robert', 'de', 'no', 'taxi', 'driver', 'comparisons', 'clearly', 'high', 'praise', 'acting', 'film', 'slowly', 'build', 'momentum', 'buildsits', 'really', 'build', 'looking', 'traditional', 'comic', 'book', 'action', 'may', 'feel', 'moves', 'bit', 'slow', 'pace', 'allows', 'transformation', 'feel', 'superficial', 'walk', 'theater', 'wont', 'know', 'exactly', 'feel', 'you', 'surely', 'want', 'know', 'everyone', 'else', 'feels']",say satisfi would somewhat mislead joaquin phoenix make feel uncomfort almost entir time couldn help think christian abl machin robert de no taxi driver comparison clearli high prais act film slowli build momentum buildsit realli build look tradit comic book action may feel move bit slow pace allow transform feel superfici walk theater wont know exactli feel you sure want know everyon els feel,say satisfi would somewhat mislead joaquin phoenix make feel uncomfort almost entir time couldn help think christian abl machin robert de no taxi driver comparison clearli high prais act film slowli build momentum buildsit realli build look tradit comic book action may feel move bit slow pace allow transform feel superfici walk theater wont know exactli feel you sure want know everyon el feel
What a joke,"Heath great in dark Knight, even liked Jared Leto in suicide squad but after seeing the countless ad's for Joker definitely don't want to watch that even if it is free to watch rather than waste money on it at the cinema. Phoenix is too depressing to watch & most of the time i want to fast forward thru his performance as too much drama to sit & watch without wanting to get up and do something like make a cup of tea. Personally would have liked to see more of Jared Leto's character of him and tougue in cheek type with Harvey Quinn with a cameo.","heath great in dark knight, even liked jared leto in suicide squad but after seeing the countless ad's for joker definitely don't want to watch that even if it is free to watch rather than waste money on it at the cinema. phoenix is too depressing to watch & most of the time i want to fast forward thru his performance as too much drama to sit & watch without wanting to get up and do something like make a cup of tea. personally would have liked to see more of jared leto's character of him and tougue in cheek type with harvey quinn with a cameo.",heath great in dark knight even liked jared leto in suicide squad but after seeing the countless ads for joker definitely dont want to watch that even if it is free to watch rather than waste money on it at the cinema phoenix is too depressing to watch  most of the time i want to fast forward thru his performance as too much drama to sit  watch without wanting to get up and do something like make a cup of tea personally would have liked to see more of jared letos character of him and tougue in cheek type with harvey quinn with a cameo,heath great in dark knight even liked jared leto in suicide squad but after seeing the countless ads for joker definitely dont want to watch that even if it is free to watch rather than waste money on it at the cinema phoenix is too depressing to watch  most of the time i want to fast forward thru his performance as too much drama to sit  watch without wanting to get up and do something like make a cup of tea personally would have liked to see more of jared letos character of him and tougue in cheek type with harvey quinn with a cameo,heath great dark knight even liked jared leto suicide squad seeing countless ads joker definitely dont want watch even free watch rather waste money cinema phoenix depressing watch time want fast forward thru performance much drama sit watch without wanting get something like make cup tea personally would liked see jared letos character tougue cheek type harvey quinn cameo,heath great dark knight even liked dared let suicide squad seeing countless as joke definitely dont want watch even free watch rather waste money cinema phoenix depressing watch time want fast forward thou performance much drama sit watch without wanting get something like make cup tea personally would liked see dared lets character tongue cheek type harvey quite cameo,"['heath', 'great', 'dark', 'knight', 'even', 'liked', 'dared', 'let', 'suicide', 'squad', 'seeing', 'countless', 'as', 'joke', 'definitely', 'dont', 'want', 'watch', 'even', 'free', 'watch', 'rather', 'waste', 'money', 'cinema', 'phoenix', 'depressing', 'watch', 'time', 'want', 'fast', 'forward', 'thou', 'performance', 'much', 'drama', 'sit', 'watch', 'without', 'wanting', 'get', 'something', 'like', 'make', 'cup', 'tea', 'personally', 'would', 'liked', 'see', 'dared', 'lets', 'character', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'type', 'harvey', 'quite', 'cameo']",heath great dark knight even like dare let suicid squad see countless as joke definit dont want watch even free watch rather wast money cinema phoenix depress watch time want fast forward thou perform much drama sit watch without want get someth like make cup tea person would like see dare let charact tongu cheek type harvey quit cameo,heath great dark knight even like dare let suicid squad see countless a joke definit dont want watch even free watch rather wast money cinema phoenix depress watch time want fast forward thou perform much drama sit watch without want get someth like make cup tea person would like see dare let charact tongu cheek type harvey quit cameo
Glad I didn't waste my money on this movie,"I was very excited about this movie when it came out in theaters and after all the raving reviews I was even more excited. I never got a chance to watch in the theater and I'm very glad I didn't. This movie was 2 hours, that felt like 4, of flat boring plot. Literally nothing happens in the movie. All it is a very mentally ill insecure man talking to a therapist, laughing, and killing people. Arthur's laugh is terrible and annoys me throughout the whole movie. Arthur has no depth or personality. This movie was so boring I started falling asleep. Anyone who things those movie is a deep and meaningful masterpiece clearly has not seen other movies. I can list off so many other movies that are much more moving and deep than this. All this movie does is try to show that the villain, The Joker, from the comics is a distraught weak man. But in reality the joker from the comics is anything but that. He was crazy but a compete mastermind. The 11 Oscar nominations are idiotic because this movie is anything but Oscar worthy.","i was very excited about this movie when it came out in theaters and after all the raving reviews i was even

Overrated,"Not sure what kind of message this movie is supposed to send. Or is it supposed to be just fun, because it's not. I don't sympathize with the main character at all, throughout the whole movie he would get on my nerves.

For a movie with this high rating I expected to see something fresh and inspirational and somehow it seems to me all the scenes and acting I've seen in this movie I saw a thousand times in bunch of other movies, like it was cliche after cliche.

Masterpiece *Movie Of the Year* Best Actor - Joaquin Phoenix*,"Wow I honestly gotta tell you, it's one of the best movies I've seen in years. All from the cinematography, thumping and sadden soundtrack, all the way to the OMG performance by Joaquin Phoenix, it's dark, it's evolving, twisting and wow just you can feel deep down to your bones his emotions portraying the Joker.

Just alone watching hearing The Jokers laugh is so twisty and evil and you could hear his sadness coming out from his mouth. You could hear the hours of practice just on the laugh alone and his method acting is perfectly on point along with his subtle gestures and dance that is done perfectly as the Joker should be. This movie has all the psychological twisting that made you believed and immersed into the movie, I was totally shocked and overwhelmed by everything even after I left the cinema. Just mind-blowned.

When I was watching in just now in the cinema, more than half the cinema cheered and applauded on certain scenes. And almost the entire patron stayed until the last credit. If u looked closely even Joker costume were evolving and changing from time to time based on his journey and experienced and just looked at the final and true form just looked absolutely stunning. Just the excitement and the dialogues told by The Joker is just so heart-crushing and it just made me felt so bad for the Joker, and it's the first time where I sided with the evil character or maybe he is the hero of this movie, who knows ?

Dumbest DC movie yet,"This has to be the dumbest DC movie yet. Way to miss the opportunity. First the Joker character is all wrong, this depicts Joker as unintelligent person with no wit.

Joaquin Phoenix delivers but the story doesn't,"While I enjoyed the film, it felt pretty short. When ""The End"" appeared on the screen I couldn't help but think - ""That's it?""

Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the Joker, and it's mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. And his Joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of Joker's madness.

However despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. Don't expect much action like in The Dark Knight trilogy. Despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other Batman flick.

This is not a bad film, but it's not a great one either. Watch it only for Joaquin's performance.","while i enjoyed the film, it felt pretty short. when ""the end"" appeared on the screen i couldn't help but think - ""that's it?"" joaquin phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the joker, and it's mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. and his joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of joker's madness. however despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. don't expect much action like in the dark knight trilogy. despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other batman flick. this is not a bad film, but it's not a great one either. watch it only for joaquin's performance.",while i enjoyed the film it felt pretty short when the end appeared on the screen i couldnt help but think  thats it joaquin phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the joker and its mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing and his joker laugh is unique  sinister and full of jokers madness however despite some minor plot twists most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers dont expect much action like in the dark knight trilogy despite the much hyped gun violence there are less guns in this movie than in any other batman flick this is not a bad film but its not a great one either watch it only for joaquins performance,while i enjoyed the film it felt pretty short when the end appeared on the screen i couldnt help but think  thats it joaquin phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the joker and its mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing and his joker laugh is unique  sinister and full of jokers madness however despite some minor plot twists most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers dont expect much action like in the dark knight trilogy despite the much hyped gun violence there are less guns in this movie than in any other batman flick this is not a bad film but its not a great one either watch it only for joaquins performance,enjoyed film felt pretty short end appeared screen couldnt help think thats joaquin phoenix fantastic new take joker mesmerizing see facial expressions keep changing joker laugh unique sinister full jokers madness however despite minor plot twists interesting bits film already shown trailers dont expect much action like dark knight trilogy despite much hyped gun violence less guns movie batman flick bad film great one either watch joaquins performance,enjoyed film felt pretty short end appeared screen couldn help think that joaquin phoenix fantastic new take joke mesmerizing see facial expressions keep changing joke laugh unique sinister full jokes madness however despite minor plot twists interesting bits film already shown trailer dont expect much action like dark knight trilogy despite much hoped gun violence less guns movie batman flick bad film great one either watch joaquins performance,"['enjoyed', 'film', 'felt', 'pretty', 'short', 'end', 'appeared', 'screen', 'couldn', 'help', 'think', 'that', 'joaquin', 'phoenix', 'fantastic', 'new', 'take', 'joke', 'mesmerizing', 'see', 'facial', 'expressions', 'keep', 'changing', 'joke', 'laugh', 'unique', 'sinister', 'full', 'jokes', 'madness', 'however', 'despite', 'minor', 'plot', 'twists', 'interesting', 'bits', 'film', 'already', 'shown', 'trailer', 'dont', 'expect', 'much', 'action', 'like', 'dark', 'knight', 'trilogy', 'despite', 'much', 'hoped', 'gun', 'violence', 'less', 'guns', 'movie', 'batman', 'flick', 'bad', 'film', 'great', 'one', 'either', 'watch', 'joaquins', 'performance']",enjoy film felt pretti short end appear screen couldn help think that joaquin phoenix fantast new take joke mesmer see facial express keep chang joke laugh uniqu sinist full joke mad howev despit minor plot twist interest bit film alreadi shown trailer dont expect much action like dark knight trilog despit much hope gun violenc less gun movi batman flick bad film great one either watch joaquin perform,enjoy film felt pretti short end appear screen couldn help think that joaquin phoenix fantast new take joke mesmer see facial express keep chang joke laugh uniqu sinist full joke mad howev despit minor plot twist interest bit film alreadi shown trailer dont expect much action like dark knight trilog despit much hope gun violenc le gun movi batman flick bad film great one either watch joaquin perform

Not the Joker at all,"This movie represents everything wrong with Hollywood. Take an existing thing, make vast changes to it to the point it is no longer the thing it was, yet still call it the same thing to profit off its popularity.

This story is of a loser at the end of his ropes. His life was sad, pathetic and he is powerless and thus...of course, lashes out at the world for it. This is a millennial's story. A person that blames everyone else, is a victim. There is no strength in this character. He isnt scary. He isnt a thing to be feared. This so called Joker, because he is without strength, knowledge could never be what the Joker actually is. Hard to kill, vastly intelligent and a criminal master-mind.

Besides undermining every single thing that is the Joker's history, it makes a mockery of the Batman universe. This ""man"", who has no criminal history, cant fight worth a damn and is a low-IQ nit-wit, can just magically become not only Batmans greatest enemy, but can hold his own against the most powerful mob bosses and villains in the DC Universe. Why? Because he hates the world because his life sucked.

Most at this point will have gone on about the deep psychological aspect of the film and claim that only a few can understand it...it is true. It is a deep psychological look at the mind of a professional victim that has failed at life and wants to burn the world because of it all while ignoring how it could never happen because a person like this could only hope to go out with a bang, literally as weak beta males can only hope to do, or ever do. It takes personal and mental strength to because a thing that gains power, keeps it, and uses it. That, makes this movie a failure on all levels other than acting. Which is supurb. Phoenix himself would make a great Joker, if he was cast to play the actual Joker.

Sadly, this movie has missed the mark on coming remotely close to being like the character that is the Joker. Any incarnation of it. At least Leto was close to the New 52 Joker, enough that makes that role, more Joker than this one.","this movie represents everything wrong with hollywood. take an existing thing, make vast changes

Well filmed but empty,"What can I say about it that hasn't already been said? It's not a terrible film, but it's not a great (or even a really good one) either. The technical aspects are great. The score and cinematography are really good. Many individual scenes are also good. But as a whole, it just feels unnecessary. Not just that, but tone deaf as well. What it's trying to say about mental illness is problematic. Why? Because it's not really sure what it's trying to say or if it's even trying to say anything about it at all.

Clear the Shelf for the Oscars,"I am not a Batman fan nor am I particularly fond of Joaquin Phoenix, but this movie was truly exceptional.

I am filling out my Oscar pool card right now.

As grotesque as a clown's smile,"My husband and I went to see this film and found it extremely depressing. Moreover, everything is caricatured. What could be more normal, you might say, given that it was a depicting the life of a comic book clown? Christopher Nolan, the director of the famous Batman trilogy, said before it was produced that this movie would be useless. Simply because when it comes to horror, the less you show, the scarier it is. If you're told that there is a giant monster in the woods and it eats people, you'll laugh and not believe it or you'll imagine the most horrible monster there is; the most horrible according to you! What others show us is never as horrible for us as what we imagine. Here, to make things really awful, we sink into the worst possible melodrama. As if psychopaths had all been mistreated during their childhood, mocked in adolescence, misunderstood in adulthood without ever having anyone to help them effectively! But no, the vast majority of them were born with a missing bolt in their heads. Something was wrong in them from the start. Here, the director wanted to make us cry by portraying roughly the most cartoonish misery. Everything is in bold capital letters, underlined and highlighted to be sure that we fully understood that the main character didn't have an easy life and that our society is so rotten that we should all revolt and suicide out of desperation or kill each other to put an end to it all. ""Why so serious ? ""asked the Ledger Joker. And that's a good question, because I'm worried about the future of this character, especially for the actors who will want to play him. In terms of the actor's performance, that's Joaquim Phoenix pushed to the extreme all over. In all his films I remember, this actor plays social misfits, loners unable to make friends, depressive people or on the verge of a nervous breakdown, misunderstood guys, sons rejected by their fathers, rebels, etc. In short, he only plays tortured souls. He even played a guy who falls in love with his computer because he can't get along with a real girlfriend. So it's normal that he knows how to play a crazy clown. Talent? If you will, considering the fact that he seems unable to play much else. This simplistic and gloomy depiction of society has already claimed victims. There are people who dress up as clowns and ransack everything in the streets and cinemas where the film is shown. It seems that some misfits wanted to believe that, as with the Joker, their misfortune depended on everything and everyone else. Their happiness couldn't certainly be up to themselves. Anyway, don't believe the good things that are said about this movie. And if you feel a bit out of sorts, don't go to see it, you'll make yourself more unhappy for a film that's really not worth it.","my husband and i went to see this film and found it extremely depressing. moreover, everything is caricatured. what could be more normal, you might say, given that it was a depicting the life of a comic book clown? christopher nolan, the director of the famous batman trilogy, said before it was produced that this movie would be useless. simply because when it comes to horror, the less you show, the scarier it is. if you're told that there is a giant monster in the woods and it eats people, you'll laugh and not believe it or you'll imagine the most horrible monster there is; the most horrible according to you! what others show us is never as horrible for us as what we imagine. here, to make things really awful, we sink into the worst possible melodrama. as if psychopaths had all been mistreated during their childhood, mocked in adolescence, misunderstood in adulthood without ever having anyone to help them effectively! but no, the vast majority of them were born with a missing bolt in their heads. something was wrong in them from the start. here, the director wanted to make us cry by portraying roughly the most cartoonish misery. everything is in bold capital letters, underlined and highlighted to be sure that we fully understood that the main character didn't have an easy life and that our society is so rotten that we should all revolt and suicide out of desperation or kill each other to put an end to it all.

"Went into this blind, and i didnt enjoy it at all really. disappointing.","I didnt really know much about this movie. I hadnt seen any trailers for it or anything but i decided to give it a go while i was stoned with my mate Steve. we actually got tickets for a different movie but couldnt find our screen so we ended up in the screen showing The Joker. It wasnt til about 45 minutes in that I realised this movie is no good. I couldnt understand a lot of what certain actors were saying it was really mumbled and low quality. The story is so confusing its hard to keep track of who's who. There's a lot of scenes where literally nothing happens except for people talking or walking down corridors. I whispered to my mate Steve about an hour in to see if he thought it was as bad as i did, but he had fallen asleep.

The good thing about the movie is the acting. the geezer who plays the joker is very good at it. Also there is a few very funny scenes near the end but other than that this movie is overly long, too complex, not enough action, and poor directing.","i didnt really know much about this movie. i

thought it was as bad as i did but he had fallen asleep the good thing about the movie is the acting the geezer who plays the joker is very good at it also there is a few very funny scenes near the end but other than that this movie is overly long too complex not enough action and poor directing,didnt really know much movie hadnt seen trailers anything decided give go stoned mate steve actually

Great,,,,,,,[],,
Very Disappointing,"Film was directed and produced poorly. Opportunity to take advantage of the incredible Joaquin Phoenix was blown.

Gratuitous violence. Misplaced violence. Wrong approach to joker.

Disappointing connection to viewer. Film was wandering for long periods. Tons of footage that should have hit the cutting room floor.

I really wanted an stirringly creepy connection with Joaquin as Joker. It wasn't there.

If you are looking for Joaquin moment like in Gladiator, you will be very disappointed.","film was directed and produced poorly. opportunity to take advantage of the incredible joaquin phoenix was blown. gratuitous violence. misplaced violence. wrong approach to joker. disappointing connection to viewer. film was wandering for long periods. tons of footage that should have hit the cutting room floor. i really wanted an stirringly creepy connection with joaquin as joker. it wasn't there. if you are looking for joaquin moment like in gladiator, you will be very disappointed.",film was directed and produced poorly opportunity to take advantage of the incredible joaquin phoenix was blown gratuitous violence misplaced violence wrong approach to joker disappointing connection to viewer film was wandering for long periods tons of footage that should have hit the cutting room floor i really wanted an stirringly creepy connection with joaquin as joker it wasnt there if you are looking for joaquin moment like in gladiator you will be very disappointed,film was directed and produced poorly opportunity to take advantage of the incredible joaquin phoenix was blown gratuitous violence misplaced violence wrong approach to joker disappointing connection to viewer film was wandering for long periods tons of footage that should have hit the cutting room floor i really wanted an stirringly creepy connection with joaquin as joker it wasnt there if you are looking for joaquin moment like in gladiator you will be very disappointed,film directed produced poorly opportunity take advantage incredible joaquin phoenix blown gratuitous violence misplaced violence wrong approach joker disappointing connection viewer film wandering long periods tons footage hit cutting room floor really wanted stirringly creepy connection joaquin joker wasnt looking joaquin moment like gladiator disappointed,film directed produced poorly opportunity take advantage incredible joaquin phoenix blown gratuitous violence misplaced violence wrong approach joke disappointing connection viewer film wandering long periods tons forage hit cutting room floor really wanted stirring creep connection joaquin joke want looking joaquin moment like gladiator disappointed,"['film', 'directed', 'produced', 'poorly', 'opportunity', 'take', 'advantage', 'incredible', 'joaquin', 'phoenix', 'blown', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'misplaced', 'violence', 'wrong', 'approach', 'joke', 'disappointing', 'connection', 'viewer', 'film', 'wandering', 'long', 'periods', 'tons', 'forage', 'hit', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'really', 'wanted', 'stirring', 'creep', 'connection', 'joaquin', 'joke', 'want', 'looking', 'joaquin', 'moment', 'like', 'gladiator', 'disappointed']",film direct produc poorli opportun take advantag incred joaquin phoenix blown gratuit violenc misplac violenc wrong approach joke disappoint connect viewer film wander long period ton forag hit cut room floor realli want stir creep connect joaquin joke want look joaquin moment like gladiat disappoint,film direct produc poorli opportun take advantag incred joaquin phoenix blown gratuit violenc misplac violenc wrong approach joke disappoint connect viewer film wander long period ton forag hit cut room floor realli want stir creep connect joaquin joke want look joaquin moment like gladiat disappoint
"By far the best DC movie to date, Joaquin Phoenix was perfect.","Wow, what a movie! I have to admit, When I first heard Joaquin Phoenix was going to be the joker, I was surprised. I wasn't sure how he was going to pull it off. I was hoping it wasn't going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the Joker came to be. One where my (adult) son wouldn't have to keep nudging me to wake me up. I was pleasantly surprised on well Todd Phillips' version played and Joaquin's acting was superb. You could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind. Just an excellent, well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a DC comic.","wow, what a movie! i have to admit, when i first heard joaquin phoenix was going to be the joker, i was surprised. i wasn't sure how he was going to pull it off. i was hoping it wasn't going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the joker came to be. one where my (adult) son wouldn't have to keep nudging me to wake me up. i was pleasantly surprised on well todd phillips' version played and joaquin's acting was superb. you could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind. just an excellent, well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a dc comic.",wow what a movie i have to admit when i first heard joaquin phoenix was going to be the joker i was surprised i wasnt sure how he was going to pull it off i was hoping it wasnt going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the joker came to be one where my adult son wouldnt have to keep nudging me to wake me up i was pleasantly surprised on well todd phillips version played and joaquins acting was superb you could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind just an excellent well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a dc comic,wow what a movie i have to admit when i first heard joaquin phoenix was going to be the joker i was surprised i wasnt sure how he was going to pull it off i was hoping it wasnt going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the joker came to be one where my adult son wouldnt have to keep nudging me to wake me up i was pleasantly surprised on well todd phillips version played and joaquins acting was superb you could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind just an excellent well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a dc comic,wow movie admit first heard joaquin phoenix going joker surprised wasnt sure going pull hoping wasnt going another cheesy rendition full fluff unrealistic explanations joker came one adult son wouldnt keep nudging wake pleasantly surprised well todd phillips version played joaquins acting superb could feel anguish character going right point lost mind excellent well acted movie almost forget derived dc comic,now movie admit first heard joaquin phoenix going joke surprised want sure going pull hoping want going another cheese condition full fluff realistic explanations joke came one adult son wouldn keep nudging wake pleasantly surprised well told phillips version played joaquins acting superb could feel anguish character going right point lost mind excellent well acted movie almost forget derived do comic,"['now', 'movie', 'admit', 'first', 'heard', 'joaquin', 'phoenix', 'going', 'joke', 'surprised', 'want', 'sure', 'going', 'pull', 'hoping', 'want', 'going', 'another', 'cheese', 'condition', 'full', 'fluff', 'realistic', 'explanations', 'joke', 'came', 'one', 'adult', 'son', 'wouldn', 'keep', 'nudging', 'wake', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'well', 'told', 'phillips', 'version', 'played', 'joaquins', 'acting', 'superb', 'could', 'feel', 'anguish', 'character', 'going', 'right', 'point', 'lost', 'mind', 'excellent', 'well', 'acted', 'movie', 'almost', 'forget', 'derived', 'do', 'comic']",now movi admit first heard joaquin phoenix go joke surpris want sure go pull hope want go anoth chees condit full fluff realist explan joke came one adult son wouldn keep nudg wake pleasantli surpris well told phillip version play joaquin act superb could feel anguish charact go right point lost mind excel well act movi almost forget deriv do comic,now movi admit first heard joaquin phoenix go joke surpris want sure go pull hope want go anoth chees condit full fluff realist explan joke came one adult son wouldn keep nudg wake pleasantli surpris well told phillip version play joaquin act superb could feel anguish charact go right point lost mind excel well act movi almost forget deriv do comic
